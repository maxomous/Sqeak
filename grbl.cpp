/* REALTIME COMMAND
 * 	- These are not considered as part of the streaming protocol and are executed instantly
 * 	- Does not require a line feed or carriage return after them.
	
		0x18 (ctrl-x) : Soft-Reset

			Immediately halts and safely resets Grbl without a power-cycle.
			Accepts and executes this command at any time.
			If reset while in motion, Grbl will throw an alarm to indicate position may be lost from the motion halt.
			If reset while not in motion, position is retained and re-homing is not required.
			An input pin is available to connect a button or switch.
		
		? : Status Report Query

			Immediately generates and sends back runtime data with a status report.
			Accepts and executes this command at any time, except during a homing cycle and when critical alarm (hard/soft limit error) is thrown.
		
		~ : Cycle Start / Resume

			Resumes a feed hold, a safety door/parking state when the door is closed, and the M0 program pause states.
			Command is otherwise ignored.
			If the parking compile-time option is enabled and the safety door state is ready to resume, Grbl will re-enable the spindle and coolant, move back into position, and then resume.
			An input pin is available to connect a button or switch.
		
		! : Feed Hold

			Places Grbl into a suspend or HOLD state. If in motion, the machine will decelerate to a stop and then be suspended.
			Command executes when Grbl is in an IDLE, RUN, or JOG state. It is otherwise ignored.
			If jogging, a feed hold will cancel the jog motion and flush all remaining jog motions in the planner buffer. The state will return from JOG to IDLE or DOOR, if was detected as ajar during the active hold.
			By machine control definition, a feed hold does not disable the spindle or coolant. Only motion.
			An input pin is available to connect a button or switch.
